## SearchAnnotations enum members

|Member |Value |Description |
|:----------|:-------------|:----------|
|None |0 |None |
|IsSearchable |1 |If a property is searchable, its value is added to the full text index. When a user performs a search, we return results if there is a search hit in one of the searchable fields or its content. Eg., If property is "Author", searching "Smith" returns items whose Author property contains "Smith". |
|IsQueryable |2 |If a property is queryable, you can query against it using knowledge query language (KQL). KQL consists of 1 or more free text keywords (words or phrases) or property restrictions. The property name must be included in the query, either specified in the query itself or included in the query programmatically. You can use prefix matching with the wildcard operator(\*) Eg., If property is "Author", search query can be "Author: Smith" |
|IsRetrievable |4 |If a property is retrievable, its value can be returned in search results. Any property that you want to add in the display template or be returned from the query and be relevant in search results must be retrievable. Marking large or too many properties as retrievable will increase search latency. Be selective and choose relevant properties. |
|IsContent |8 |Content property is to identify a property that can be full text indexed. Admins will choose among the available properties as to which should be the property to be treated as content for that specific connection. More on the content property [here](/graph/connecting-external-content-manage-items#content) |
|IsRefinable |16 |If a property is refinable, an admin can configure it as a custom filter in the Microsoft Search results page. A refinable property cannot be searchable. |

## SearchPropertyLabel

These are well-known tags published by Microsoft that you can add against a property in your schema. Adding a semantic label helps various Microsoft products understand the property and provide a better experience. Read more [here](/graph/connecting-external-content-manage-schema#semantic-labels)
