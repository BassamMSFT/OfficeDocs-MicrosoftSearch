# Microsoft Graph connectors SDK publishing steps for custom connectors in the Microsoft 365 admin center

When you use the Microsoft Graph connectors SDK you can publish your custom connectors through the Microsoft 265 admin center, the same way as a Microsoft's built-in connectors.

The following steps show how to publish a connection for your custom connector:

1. [Add a Microsoft Graph connector in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoftsearch/configure-connector#step-1-add-a-microsoft-graph-connector-in-the-microsoft-365-admin-center)

2. Choose "Custom Connector" option and provide manifest details in the format below:

    ```json
    {
      // This is the unique connector id/provider id
      "connectorId": "<ConnectorGuid>",
    
      // This is list of all supported auth types. Remove the ones that the connector does not support.
      "authTypes": [ "Windows, Basic, Anonymous, OAuth2ClientCredentials" ],
      
      // The list of additional crawl types that the connector supports in addition to full and periodic full crawl. This is an optional field.
      "additionalCrawlsSupported": [ "Incremental" ]
    }

    ```

    a. connectorId should be a GUID. This field is the same as ConnectorUniqueId in the Connector Info Service implementation file or the GUID that you define.

    b. AuthTypes must be a non-empty array with one or more of the following types: Anonymous/Basic/Windows/OAuth.

    c. Defining crawl types in addition to full and period full crawl is optional depending on the implementation and data source support.

    >[!Note]
    > The manifest file is generated automatically in the output directory of your project if you're using the C# project template. You may edit/update the manifest file as required.

3. [Name the connection](/microsoftsearch/configure-connector#step-2-name-the-connection)

4. Provide the URL to the data source you're connecting to and credentials to access it. Choose the Graph connector Agent available, and validate the information provided. Select Next on success.

5. Provide any extra configuration if required by your connector. You can pass any information specific to the connection to the datasource. For example, if you're building a connector for Azure DevOps Services, the projects that need to be indexed can be the extra parameters. For a Wiki connector, the subsections that need to be indexed can be the more parameters. The API to query the wiki can take these filters specified in the extra parameters and get the items from data source.

    The data in the parameter is opaque to the platform. It's serialized and stored as a string and passed to the connector. The connector can deserialize this data as required and use it.

6. [Assign property labels](/microsoftsearch/configure-connector#step-6-assign-property-labels)

7. [Manage Schema](/microsoftsearch/configure-connector#step-7-manage-schema)

8. [Manage Search permissions](/microsoftsearch/configure-connector#step-5-manage-search-permissions) Only Azure AD based access control lists are supported for only people with access to the data source.

9. Select [refresh frequencies](/microsoftsearch/configure-connector#step-8-refresh-settings) of crawls

10. [Review](/microsoftsearch/configure-connector#step-9-review-connection) the details provided and select Finish

11. [Customize the search results page](/microsoftsearch/configure-connector#step-10-customize-the-search-results-page)

12. [Confirm if the connection setup worked](/microsoftsearch/configure-connector#step-11-confirm-if-the-connection-setup-worked)
