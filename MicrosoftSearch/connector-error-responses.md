# Microsoft Graph connectors overview for Microsoft Search and Microsoft 365 Copilot

Microsoft Search indexes all your [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365) data to make it searchable for users. With Microsoft Graph connectors, your organization can index third-party data so that it appears in Microsoft Search and Microsoft 365 Copilot results. This feature expands the types of content sources that are searchable in your Microsoft 365 productivity apps and the broader Microsoft ecosystem. The third-party data can be hosted on-premises or in the public or private clouds. Microsoft Graph connectors honor the source permissions as configured in your content source. As a result, users in your organization will only be able to view content to which they have access.
