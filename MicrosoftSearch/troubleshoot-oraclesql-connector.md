# Troubleshooting guide for Oracle SQL Microsoft Graph connector

### 1. **Underneath is a list of common errors observed while configuring the connector and their possible reasons.**

| Configuration step | Error message | Possible reasons |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Database settings | `Error from database server: Connection request timed out` | Invalid hostname <br> host not reachable. |
| Database settings | `Error from database server: ORA-12541: TNS: No listener` | Invalid port. |
| Database settings | `Error from database server: ORA-12514: TNS: listener does not currently know of service requested in connector descriptor` | Invalid service (database) name. |
| Database settings | `Error from database server: Login failed for user 'user'.` | Invalid username or password. |
| Full crawl | `Column column_name returned from full crawl SQL query contains non-alphanumeric character` | Nonalphanumeric characters (like underscores) are not allowed in column names in the SELECT clause. Use aliases to rename columns and remove nonalphanumeric characters (Example - SELECT column_name AS columnName). |
