# Manage Power BI search results

Users need to find data and analytics so that they can take informed decisions. To make it easier for users, Microsoft Search has added support to search for Power BI dashboards and reports. A few benefits of Power BI search are

* **Easy to use** This out-of-box search experience helps users find Power BI dashboards and reports easily across your organization.
* **Richer content** To make Power BI search results more useful, they include key information like the type of content (dashboard or report) and the team or person who owns it.
* **Unified search experience** To maintain a cohesive experience, Power BI results are consistent across all search entry points. Wherever you search, you'll get the same results with the same look and feel.

## What users experience

Microsoft Search users can search for Power BI results from the Windows search box, SharePoint, Microsoft 365, and Bing. 

Power BI results can be queried from All tab on the Search page

Power BI results can also be queried from the dedicated Power BI Custom vertical

## Manage Power BI search 

Power BI results are enabled by default. Your Power BI admin can manage them at any time. To manage in the Power BI Admin portal, go to Tenant settings and toggle the **Share data with your Microsoft 365 Services** setting. To learn more, see [Administering Power BI in the admin portal](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-portal#use-global-search-for-power-bi-preview).

Power BI search vertical is enabled by default in the list of verticals. It can be disabled from the Verticals page if required.

> [!NOTE]
> When using Microsoft Search, your search query and the results returned from Power BI, may be processed in a region or geography different than where your Power BI data is located.

## Limitations

* PowerBI inline results experience isn't available in SharePoint site search scope.
* All vertical configurations don't apply to PowerBI content. Example: The All-tab keyword query language filter (KQL) "FileType:xlsx" can be used to filter out Excel files from SharePoint and OneDrive, but will not prevent PowerBI content from showing.
* All vertical sorting by date don't apply to PowerBI results. Sorting by date instead of relevance will exclude PowerBI results.
