# Manage Power BI answers

To make it easier for your users to find the data and analytics they need to make informed decisions, Microsoft Search has added support for Power BI dashboards and reports. Here are a few of the benefits of Power BI search:

* **Easy to use:** This out-of-box search experience helps users easily and quickly find Power BI dashboards and reports across your organization.
* **Richer content:** To make Power BI search results more useful, they include key information like the type of content—dashboard or report—and the team or person that owns it.
* **Unified search experience:** To maintain a cohesive experience, Power BI results are consistent across all search entry points. Wherever you search, you'll get the same results with the same look and feel.

## What users experience

Microsoft Search users can find Power BI results by searching from the Windows search box, SharePoint, Office 365, and Bing. 

PowerBI results can be queried from All tab

As well as from the custom vertical

## Manage Power BI search 

Power BI results are enabled for your organization by default. Your Power BI admin can manage them at any time. In the Power BI Admin portal, go to Tenant settings and toggle the **Share data with your Microsoft 365 Services** setting. To learn more, see [Administering Power BI in the admin portal](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-portal#use-global-search-for-power-bi-preview).

By default the PowerBI search vertical is enabled in the list of verticals. It can be disabled from the vertical page too.

> [!NOTE]
> When using Microsoft Search, your search query and the results returned from Power BI may be processed in a region or geography that's different than where your Power BI tenant data is located.
