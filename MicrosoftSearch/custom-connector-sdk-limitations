# Graph connectors SDK Known limitations

Known limitations:

1. Auth mechanisms: Currently we only support 3 types of data source authentication mechanisms:
a. Basic authentication
b. Windows authentication
c. Anonymous
OAuth support is currently unavailable.
2. Crawl mechanisms: Currently we only support full crawls for list-based traversal. Incremental crawls and graph-based traversals are not supported.
3. Search permissions: Currently we support ACL trimming only based on AAD through the SDK. ACLing based on data source groups is not yet available.
