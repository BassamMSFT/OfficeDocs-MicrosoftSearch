# Searching and validating indexed Content Microsoft Graph connectors

You can now search to determine if specific content is indexed. If it is, you can also review its associated properties and access permissions.

## Using this feature

### Testing indexing
When testing your connection and unable to locate a particular item. b. Property and User Access Verification: When an item is indexed, you need to review its associated metadata and access control lists (ACLs). c. Troubleshooting Search Issues: If users report issues accessing items, use this feature to confirm proper indexing and correct data inclusion.

About the Index Browser: When you enter an item ID to check its indexing status, if the item is indexed, you will see the following details:

*Properties: Displays the status of all properties defined during the itemâ€™s configuration.
*Permissions: Lists all groups and individual users associated with the item.
*Check user access: Allows you to search for a specific user to verify their access to the item.

The index browser shows the name of the content, its status, and the date it was last refreshed.
