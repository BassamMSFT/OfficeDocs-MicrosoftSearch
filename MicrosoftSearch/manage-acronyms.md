# Manage Acronyms answers in Microsoft Search

Users often run into unfamiliar acronyms and abbreviations used by their organization or team. Terms that are specific to organizations or teams might be new to people who move from one team to another, work with internal partner teams, or are new to the organization.

Organizations don't always have a single reference for their standard terminology. Lack of a single reference makes it hard to find definitions or expansions for these acronyms. Microsoft Search solves that problem with Acronyms.

## What users experience

Microsoft Search users can get definitions with Acronyms in [Bing](https://Bing.com), [SharePoint](https://products.office.com/sharepoint/collaboration), and [Office 365](https://Office.com). In the **Search** box, users enter queries like these examples:

- *What is* DNN
- *Define* DNN
- DNN *definition*
- *Expand* DNN
- DNN *expansion*
- *Meaning of* DNN
- DNN *means*

The result includes all the meanings of DNN that are present within the user’s organization.

> [!NOTE]
> Users must enter a query that includes the acronym’s specified *keywords* to trigger its corresponding answers. Acronym queries are not case sensitive.

## Set up Acronyms answers

In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), go to [**Acronyms**](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/MicrosoftSearch/acronyms), and then select **Add acronym**.

Microsoft Search queries two data sources to provide Acronyms answers to users’ searches:

1. **Editorial acronyms**. Provided by IT administrators in the [admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/MicrosoftSearch/acronyms).
2. **Mined acronyms**. Mined by Microsoft Search from the user’s personal email and documents and publicly available data within the organization.

### Set up editorial acronyms

Search administrators can set up editorial acronyms on the [Acronyms tab](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/MicrosoftSearch/acronyms) in the  [Microsoft Search admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/MicrosoftSearch). You can add acronyms from any internal site or repository to the admin center. Editorial acronyms can be added to **Published** or **Draft** state:

**Published state**. Acronyms are available to the organization’s employees through Microsoft Search.

> [!NOTE]
> It might take up to three days for acronyms added to Published state to become available in Microsoft Search.

**Draft state**. If admins want to review Acronyms answers before making them available in Microsoft Search, they can add the acronyms to Draft state. Acronyms added to Draft state aren’t available in Microsoft Search. Admins need to add the acronyms to Published state to make them available.

Admins can add acronyms individually or bulk import them in a CSV file. Upload a CSV file with the fields shown in the following table:

| Acronym (mandatory) | Expansion (mandatory) | Description  | Source | State (mandatory) |
| --------- | --------- | ---------- | --------- |--------- |
| *XXX* | *Spelled out abbreviation* |  | *URL* | *Published or Draft* |

### CSV fields

**Acronym**. Contains the actual short form or acronym. An example is *DNN*.

**Expansion**. Contains the expansion of the acronym. An example is *Deep Neural Network*.

**Description**. A brief description of the acronym that gives users more info about the acronym and its expansion. For example, *A deep neural network is a neural network with a certain level of complexity, a neural network with more than two layers*.

**Source**. The URL of the page or website where you want users to go for more information about the acronym.

**State**. This field can take two values:

- **Draft**. Adds  the acronym to the Draft state.
- **Published**. Adds the acronym to the Published state and makes it available in Microsoft Search.

### Mined acronyms

It might be a challenge for admins to add all the acronyms used within an organization to Answers. This feature can find acronyms that search administrators aren’t even aware of. To do that work, Microsoft Search also mines acronyms from these sources:

- Users’ emails.
- Documents in [SharePoint](https://products.office.com/sharepoint/collaboration), [Microsoft OneDrive]( https://onedrive.live.com/about/), and [Microsoft OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/).
- Public documents within the organization that users have access to in SharePoint, OneDrive, or OneNote.

Microsoft Search makes sure that only users with access and permissions to a document can see the acronyms that are mined from it. When an acronym is mined from a user's mailbox, only that user can see that acronym.

> [!NOTE]
> No setup is needed for mined acronyms.
