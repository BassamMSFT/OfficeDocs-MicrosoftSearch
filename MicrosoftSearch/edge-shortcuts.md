# Enable and customize address bar shortcuts for Microsoft Edge

Help your users stay focused and find work results faster. Just enable Microsoft Search in Bing shortcuts for the Edge address bar. Users can then type 'work' or your organization's name in the address bar, press the Spacebar or Tab key, type their search, and press the Enter key. The work results page will appear with relevant answers and results. Also, you can change or remove the existing shortcut keywords and add your own custom shortcuts.

## Customize or disable shortcuts in Edge

Shortcuts are enabled by default along with two keywords - your organization's name and 'work.' To add more keywords or turn off shortcuts:

1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), go to [Configurations](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/MicrosoftSearch/configurations).
2. Under Change Microsoft Search in Bing Extension settings, select **Edit**.
3. In the Microsoft Search in Bing panel, under Microsoft Search in Bing Shortcut, select **Allow users to use Microsoft Search in Bing Shortcut**.
4. In **Search Keywords**, you'll see 'work' and your organization name (without spaces). You can remove the default keywords or add new ones. When adding keywords, there are a few things to keep in mind:
    - Can't include spaces or special characters
    - Can only have four keywords
5. Select **Save**.

## Frequently asked questions

**Q: Do these shortcuts only support English keywords?**

**A:** No. When the default keyword 'work' is typed in another language and the user presses the Spacebar or Tab key, Edge will recognize it as a shortcut key for work results. For other keywords, you'll need to add the language-specific keyword in the **Search Keywords** field.

**Q: How long does it take for new keywords to be recognized as shortcuts?**

**A:**  It takes up to two days for Edge to recognize custom keywords as a shortcut.

**Q: Can I add shortcuts for my Google Chrome users?**

**A**: Not through the Microsoft 365 admin center. They can create their own shortcuts in Chrome settings.

**Q: Can I use these same keywords when using Windows Search?**

**A**: No, only Microsoft Edge supports these keywords shortcuts.
