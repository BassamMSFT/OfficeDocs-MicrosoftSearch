# Customize or disable address bar shortcuts for Microsoft Edge

Help your users stay focused and find work results faster when searching from the Microsoft Edge address bar. Shortcuts are enabled by default along with two keywords - your organization's name and 'work.' When using Edge, users can then type one of the keywords in the address bar, press the Spacebar or Tab key, type their search, and press the Enter key. The work results page will appear with relevant answers and results. Also, you can add your own custom shortcuts.

## To add keywords or turn off shortcuts

1. In the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com), go to [Configurations](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/MicrosoftSearch/configurations).
2. Under Microsoft Search in Bing settings, select **Change settings**.
3. In the Microsoft Search in Bing panel, under Microsoft Search in Bing Shortcut, **Enable the Microsoft Search in Bing shortcut** is selected by default. To disable these shortcuts, clear the check box.
4. In Search Keywords field, you'll see 'work' and your organization name (without spaces). When entering another keywords, there are a few things to keep in mind:
    - Don't include spaces or special characters
    - You can have a maximum of four keywords
5. Select **Save**.

## Frequently asked questions

**Q: Do these shortcuts only support English keywords?**

**A:** No. For localized keywords, you'll need to add the language-specific keyword in the Search Keywords field.

**Q: How long does it take for new keywords to be recognized as shortcuts?**

**A:**  It takes up to two days for Edge to recognize custom keywords as a shortcut.

**Q: Can I add shortcuts for my Google Chrome users?**

**A**: Not through the Microsoft 365 admin center. They can create their own shortcuts in Chrome by going to settings for Manage search engines, and, under Other search engines, adding a site name, keyword, and Query URL.

**Q: Can I use these same keywords when using Windows Search?**

**A**: No, only Microsoft Edge supports these keywords shortcuts.
