# Azure DevOps Graph connector (preview)

The Azure DevOps Graph connector allows your organization to index work items in its instance of the Azure DevOps service. After you configure the connector and index content from Azure DevOps, end users can search for those items in Microsoft Search.

> [!NOTE]
> Read the [**Setup your Graph connector**](configure-connector.md) article to understand the general Graph connectors setup process.

This article is for anyone who configures, runs, and monitors a ServiceNow Graph connector. It supplements the general setup process, and shows instructions that apply only for the ServiceNow Graph connector.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The Azure DevOps connector supports only the Azure DevOps cloud service. Azure DevOps Server 2019, TFS 2018, TFS 2017, TFS 2015, and TFS 2013 are not supported by this connector.

instructions.-->

## Step 2: Name the connection

## Step 3: Configure the connection settings

To connect to your Azure DevOps instance, you need your Azure DevOps [organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization) name, its App ID, and client secret for OAuth authentication.

### Register an app

Register an app in Azure DevOps so that the Microsoft Search app can access the instance. To learn more, see Azure DevOps documentation on how to [register an app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/integrate/get-started/authentication/oauth?view=azure-devops#register-your-app).

The following table provides guidance on how to fill out the app registration form:

 **Mandatory Fields** | **Description**      | **Recommended Value**
--- | --- | ---
| Company Name         | The name of your company. | Use an appropriate value   |
| Application name     | A unique value that identifies the application that you're authorizing.    | Microsoft Search     |
| Application website  | The URL of the application that will request access to your Azure DevOps instance during connector setup. (Required).  | <https://gcs.office.com/>                |
| Authorization callback URL        | A required callback URL that the authorization server redirects to. | <https://gcs.office.com/v1.0/admin/oauth/callback>|
| Authorized scopes | The scope of access for the application | Select the following scopes: Identity (read), Work Items (read), Variable Groups (read), Project and team (read), Graph (read)|

On registering the app with the details above, you'll get the **App ID** and **Client Secret** that will be used to configure the connector.

>[!NOTE]
>To revoke access to any app registered in Azure DevOps, go to User settings at the right top of your Azure DevOps instance. Select Profile and then select Authorizations in the Security section of the side pane. Hover over an authorized OAuth app to see the Revoke button at the corner of the app details.

### Connection settings

After registering the Microsoft Search app with Azure DevOps, you can complete the connection settings step. Enter your organization name, App ID, and Client secret.

### Configure data: select projects and fields

You can choose for the connection to index either the entire organization or specific projects.

If you choose to index the entire organization, items in all projects in the organization will get indexed. New projects and items will be indexed during the next crawl after they're created.

If you choose individual projects, only work items in those projects will be indexed.

Next, select which fields you want the connection to index and preview data in these fields before proceeding.

## Step 4: Manage search permissions

The Azure DevOps connector supports search permissions visible toâ€¯**Only people with access to this data source** or **Everyone**. If you choose **Only people with access to this data source**, indexed data will appear in the search results for users who have access to them based on permissions to users or groups at the Organization, Project or Area path level in Azure DevOps. If you choose **Everyone**, indexed data will appear in the search results for all users.

## Step 5: Assign property labels

Follow the general [setup instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftsearch/configure-connector).

## Step 6: Manage schema

Follow the general [setup instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftsearch/configure-connector).

## Step 7: Choose refresh settings

The Azure DevOps connector supports refresh schedules for both full and incremental crawls.
The recommended schedule is one hour for an incremental crawl and one day for a full crawl.

## Step 8: Review connection

Follow the general [setup instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftsearch/configure-connector).
