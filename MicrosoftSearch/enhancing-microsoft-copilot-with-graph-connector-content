# Enhancing Microsoft Copilot Discovery with Graph Connector Content

As administrators, you can enhance the discoverability of Microsoft Graph Connector content within Microsoft Copilot by leveraging connection name and description. For example, when users refer explicitly to a specific connection, the connection name can inform Microsoft Copilot to look for pertinent information in that connection. Similarly, if users refer to content or use cases that are described generically in the connection description, the description can hint Microsoft Copilot that relevant content might be available in that connection.
>[!Note]
>Microsoft Copilot does not automatically trigger Graph Connector content if a user explicitly specifies a connection name or asks for information on a scenario described in the connection description. Microsoft Copilot is not a keyword-matching but an AI system, using many inputs from many sources to generate its responses.

## How to modify the description

### Microsoft-built connectors

For Microsoft-built connectors, administrators have the flexibility to modify the connection name and description in the admin portal at any time to reflect updates or changes in the content. These modifications are swiftly propagated to the system, typically within minutes, ensuring that users always have access to the most current information.

   1. Go to the M365 Admin portal. In the navigation pane, select **Settings**, and then select **Search & intelligence**. 
   2. Select the [Data sources tab](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/MicrosoftSearch/Connectors).
   3. Select the connector that you would like to update the description for and click 'Edit' at the bottom of the right panel.

   4. In the 'Name and ID' step, you will find the description field. Add a description that best fits your organization's scenarios.

   >[!Note]
   >1. Microsoft Graph Connectors for Jira, ServiceNow Tickets, ADO Work Items, and Salesforce have a default description tailored to the generic use of the connectors.
   >2. We still advise reviewing and modifying the descriptions to tailor them to the specific terms/language used by your organization.
   >3. For on-prem connectors, the connector description must be updated using the connector API. See more information here: [Microsoft Graph connector agent | Microsoft Learn](/MicrosoftSearch/graph-connector-agent.md)

   ### Good practices to write a connector description

   The connection description serves as a crucial element in aiding users to locate the desired content. Make sure that the following elements are present:
   * A brief overview of the content type. 
   * The scope of the content available within the connection. 
   * Keywords that users might employ to find this content (ex. _Tickets_, _Wiki_, _Knowledge Base_, _How to_, etc.).
   * Alternative names for the connection that users might be familiar with. 

#### Examples of connection names and description
Here are three examples of effective connection names and descriptions: 

1. **JIRA**: This connection to Jira contains tickets to track issues related to software development and business project management. Jira may also be used for service desk tickets, product management, and other daily work item management. It is used to run scrums and track progress on initiatives, especially within engineering and product teams.

   _Keywords - Issues, Bugs, Tasks, Sub-tasks, Epic, User Story, Tickets, Backlog, Atlassian Jira_
2. **ServiceNow Tickets**: This connection is used to manage and track customer requests and IT incidents. Businesses use this tool to enhance their service delivery and ensure issues are resolved on time.

3. **ADO Work Items**: This connection to Azure DevOps Work items contains tickets to track software development and business projects. It is used by engineering and product teams to track daily work, run scrums and track progress on initiatives.

   _Keywords - Work items, Bugs, Tasks, Epic, User Story, Tickets, Backlog, Issue, ADO, Azure DevOps_

4. **Salesforce**: Content related to Salesforce helps companies streamline their customer relationship management by providing a unified view of customer data across various business functions. Salesforce facilitates improved customer interactions, efficient data management, and enhanced analytical insights  

   Salesforce CRM stores a wide range of data to support various business functions. Types of data stored in Salesforce CRM include common record categories such as Leads, Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities, and Cases. Salesforce CRM's data model is designed to make data understandable and accessible, representing database tables as objects, columns as fields, and rows as records. 

   The content in this connection can also be referred to as SFDC, Salesforce data or Salesforce Sales cloud.
