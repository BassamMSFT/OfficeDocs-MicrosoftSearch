# Troubleshooting guide for File Share Microsoft Graph connector  

### 1. **The following are common errors observed while configuring the connector, or during crawling, and its possible reasons.**

| Configuration step | Error message | Possible reason(s) |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Authentication | There are some errors with file paths or URLs. *The Graph connector agent associated with the connection is not reachable.* | Check if the agent is running or if the app credentials have been expired or revoked. Refer to [Graph connector agent troubleshooting](./graph-connector-agent.md#troubleshooting)  |
| Authentication | There are some errors with file paths or URLs. *No files were found in the path provided. The client doesn't have permission to perform the action.* | Check if the path is correct and the account provided has access to the files. |
| Authentication | There are some errors with file paths or URLs. *The user account provided does not have permissions for the files in this location.*  | Check if the client does have permission to perform the action, if the path is correct and the account provided has access to the files. |
| Authentication | There are some errors with file paths or URLs. *Incorrect username or password.* | Check the authentication details with the data source. The username or password is incorrect, if the credentials are not correct, we don't check the file path access. |
| Crawling | There are some errors with file paths or URLs. *You don't have permission to access this data source. You can contact the owner of this data source to request permission. â€œPreserve Last Access" is enabled for the connection which requires "write" permissions on the file to update the access time.* | Check if "write" permissions are provided to the file/root directory. This occurs when provided credentials do not have 'Write' permission needed to preserve file's last access time. |

To get more information on the types of errors, go to the **error details** page after selecting the connection. Select the **error code** to see more detailed errors. Also refer to [Monitor your connections](./manage-connector.md) to learn more.
