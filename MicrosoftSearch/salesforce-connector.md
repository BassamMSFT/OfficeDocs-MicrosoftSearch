# Salesforce Graph Connector

With the Salesforce Graph connector, your organization can index Contacts, Opportunities, Leads and Accounts objects in your Salesforce instance. After you configure the connector and index content from Salesforce, end users can search for those items from any Microsoft Search client. 

This article is for [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365) administrators or anyone who configures, runs, and monitors a Salesforce connector . It explains how to configure your connector and connector capabilities, limitations, and troubleshooting techniques.   

>[!IMPORTANT] 
> The Salesforce Graph connector currently supports Summer ’20, Spring’20, Winter’20, and Summer ’19 versions.
