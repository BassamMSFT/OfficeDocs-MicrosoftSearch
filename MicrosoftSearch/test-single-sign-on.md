# Test single sign-on

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article applies to the Microsoft Search in Bing admin portal. Weâ€™re moving the portal to the Microsoft 365 admin center, and then the Microsoft Search in Bing portal will be removed. We recommend that you use the Microsoft 365 admin center to get started. [Overview of Microsoft Search](overview-microsoft-search.md).
    
Single sign-on reduces the number of times users are prompted to sign in. Testing single sign-on with a small group of users will help identify any blocking configuration issues. 
  
For Chrome users on Windows 10, single sign-on will only work if the Windows 10 and AAD sign-in extension for Chrome is installed.
