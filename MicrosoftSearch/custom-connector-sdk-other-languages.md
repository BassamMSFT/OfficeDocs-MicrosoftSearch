# Microsoft Graph connectors SDK other languages

You can develop your custom connector in languages other than C\#, following the steps indicated here:

1. Install the Microsoft Graph connector agent and follow the instructions to register it [here](/MicrosoftSearch/graph-connector-agent).

2. Download the protocol buffer files with gRPC contracts from [here](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-connectors-sdk/tree/main/Contracts).

3. Download the protobuf compiler from [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases)and extract it.

    * Update the environment path with the bin folder in the extracted root.
    * Compile "contracts" to create **server-side stubs** in the language of your choice. More information can be found [here](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/).

4. Create a project in your integrated development environment (IDE) and place all the protocol files in a folder named "Contracts".

    You may create a project with the sample structure given below:

5. Implement methods in the stubs generated by the compiler.

6. Create a server, run the application and generate the executable/output binaries.

7. Test the connector code using the [TestApp utility](/MicrosoftSearch/custom-connector-sdk-testapp).

8. [Publish a connection](/MicrosoftSearch/custom-connector-sdk-publish) for your custom connector on the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/adminportal/home#/MicrosoftSearch/Connectors/add).
