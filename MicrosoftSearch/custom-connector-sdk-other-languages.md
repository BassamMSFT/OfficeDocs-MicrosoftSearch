# Develop your custom connector in languages other than C\#

1. Install Graph Connector Agent and follow the instructions to register the agent [here](/MicrosoftSearch/graph-connector-agent).

2. Download the protocol buffer files with gRPC contracts from [here](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-connectors-sdk/tree/main/Contracts).

3. Download the protobuf compiler from [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases)and extract it .

    * Update the environment path with bin folder in extracted root.
    * Compile contracts to create **server-side stubs** in the language of your choice. More information can be found [here](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/).

4. Create a project in your IDE and place all the proto files in a folder named "**Contracts**".

    You may create a project with the sample structure given below:

    ![Sample project structure](media/connectors-sdk/projectstructure.png)

5. Implement methods in the stubs generated by the compiler.

6. Create a server, run the application and generate the executable/output binaries.

7. Test the connector code using the [TestApp utility](/MicrosoftSearch/custom-connector-sdk-testapp).

8. [Publish a connection](/MicrosoftSearch/custom-connector-sdk-publish) for your custom connector on Microsoft 365 Admin Center.
