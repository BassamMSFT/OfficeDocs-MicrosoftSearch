# ServiceNow Knowledge Graph Connector

With the Microsoft Graph Connector for ServiceNow, your organization can index knowledge-base articles that are visible to all users or restricted with user criteria permissions within your organization. After you configure the connector and index content from ServiceNow, end users can search for those articles from any Microsoft Search client.  

You can also refer [the following video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVSkJpk1RiE) to learn more about Graph Connector's capability in managing search permissions.

[![Managing Search Permissions in Microsoft Graph Connector for ServiceNow](https://img.youtube.com/vi/TVSkJpk1RiE/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVSkJpk1RiE)

This article is for Microsoft 365 administrators or anyone who configures, runs, and monitors a ServiceNow Knowledge Graph  connector. It supplements the general instructions provided in the [Set up your Graph connector](configure-connector.md) article. If you have not already done so, read the entire Set up your Graph Connector article to understand the general setup process.

Each step in the setup process is listed below along with either a note that indicates you should follow the general setup instructions OR 
other instructions that apply to only ServiceNow Graph connector including information about [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) 
and [Limitations](#limitations).  

## Step 1: Add a Graph connector in the Microsoft 365 admin center.
Follow the general setup instructions.

## Step 2: Name the connection.
Follow the general setup instructions.


## Step 3: Connection Settings
To connect to your ServiceNow data, you need your organization's **ServiceNow instance URL**. Your organizationâ€™s ServiceNow instance URL typically looks like **https://&lt;your-organization-domain>.service-now.com**. 

Along with this URL, you will need a **service account** for setting up the connection to ServiceNow as well as for allowing Microsoft Search to periodically update the knowledge articles based on the refresh schedule. The service account will need read access to the following **ServiceNow table records** to successfully crawl various entities.

**Feature** | **Read access required tables** | **Description**
--- | --- | ---
Index knowledge articles available to <em>Everyone</em> | kb_knowledge | For crawling knowledge articles
Index and support user criteria permissions | kb_uc_can_read_mtom | Who can read this knowledge base
| | kb_uc_can_contribute_mtom | Who can contribute to this knowledge base
| | kb_uc_cannot_read_mtom | Who cannot read this knowledge base
| | kb_uc_cannot_contribute_mtom | Who cannot contribute to this knowledge base
| | sys_user | Read user table
| | sys_user_has_role | Read role information of users
| | sys_user_grmember | Read group membership of users
| | user_criteria | Read user criteria permissions
| | kb_knowledge_base | Read knowledge base information

You can **create and assign a role** for the service account you use to connect with Microsoft Search. [Learn how to assign role for ServiceNow accounts](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/paris-platform-administration/page/administer/users-and-groups/task/t_AssignARoleToAUser.html). Read access to the tables can be assigned on the created role. To learn about setting read access to table records, see [Securing Table Records](https://developer.servicenow.com/dev.do#!/learn/learning-plans/orlando/new_to_servicenow/app_store_learnv2_securingapps_orlando_creating_and_editing_access_controls). 


>[!NOTE]
> ServiceNow Graph Connector can index knowledge articles and user criteria permissions without advanced scripts. If a user criteria contains advanced script all the related knowledge articles will be hidden from search results.

To authenticate and sync content from ServiceNow, choose **one of three** supported methods: 
 
- Basic authentication 
- ServiceNow OAuth (recommended)
- Azure AD OpenID Connect

## Step 3.1: Basic authentication

Enter the username and password of ServiceNow account with **knowledge** role to authenticate to your instance.

## Step 3.2: ServiceNow OAuth

To use ServiceNow OAuth for authentication, a ServiceNow admin needs to provision an endpoint in your ServiceNow instance, so that the Microsoft Search app can access it. To learn more, see [Create an endpoint for clients to access the instance](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/newyork-platform-administration/page/administer/security/task/t_CreateEndpointforExternalClients.html) in the ServiceNow documentation.

The following table provides guidance on how to fill out the endpoint creation form:

Field | Description | Recommended Value 
--- | --- | ---
Name | Unique value that identifies the application that you require OAuth access for. | Microsoft Search
Client ID | A read-only, auto generated unique ID for the application. The instance uses the client ID when it requests an access token. | NA
Client secret | With this shared secret string, the ServiceNow instance and Microsoft Search authorize communications with each other. | Follow security best-practices by treating the secret as a password.
Redirect URL | A required callback URL that the authorization server redirects to. | https://gcs.office.com/v1.0/admin/oauth/callback
Logo URL | A URL that contains the image for the application logo. | NA
Active | Select the check box to make the application registry active. | Set to active
Refresh token lifespan | The number of seconds that a refresh token is valid. By default, refresh tokens expire in 100 days (8,640,000 seconds). | 31,536,000 (1 year)
Access token lifespan | The number of seconds that an access token is valid. | 43,200 (12 hours)

Enter the client id and client secret to connect to your instance. After connecting, use a ServiceNow account credential to authenticate permission to crawl. The account should at least have **knowledge** role. Refer the table in the beginning of [step 3: connection settings](#step-3-connection-settings) for providing read access to more ServiceNow table records and index user criteria permissions.

## Step 3.3: Azure AD OpenID Connect

To use Azure AD OpenID Connect for authentication, follow the steps below.

### Step 3.3.1: Register a new application in Azure Active Directory

To learn about registering a new application in Azure Active Directory, see [Register an application](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#register-an-application). Select single tenant organizational directory. Redirect URI isn't needed. After registration, note down the Application (client) ID and Directory (tenant) ID.

### Step 3.3.2: Create a client secret

To learn about creating a client secret, see [Creating a client secret](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-a-client-secret). Take a note of client secret.

### Step 3.3.3: Retrieve Service Principal Object Identifier

Follow the steps to retrieve Service Principal Object Identifier

1. Run PowerShell.

2. Install Azure PowerShell using the following command.

   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

3. Connect to Azure.

   ```powershell
   Connect-AzAccount
   ```

4. Get Service Principal Object Identifier.

   ```powershell
   Get-AzADServicePrincipal -ApplicationId "Application-ID"
   ```
   Replace "Application-ID" with Application (client) ID (without quotes) of the application you registered in step 3.a. Note the value of ID object from PowerShell output. It's the Service Principal ID.

Now you have all the information required from Azure portal. A quick summary of the information is given in the table below.

Property | Description 
--- | ---
Directory ID (Tenant ID) | Unique ID of the Azure Active Directory tenant, from step 3.a.
Application ID (Client ID) | Unique ID of the application registered in step 3.a.
Client Secret | The secret key of the application (from step 3.b). Treat it like a password.
Service Principal ID | An identity for the application running as a service. (from step 3.c)

### Step 3.3.4: Register ServiceNow Application

The ServiceNow instance needs the following configuration:

1. Register a new OAuth OIDC entity. To learn, see [Create an OAuth OIDC provider](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/orlando-platform-administration/page/administer/security/task/add-OIDC-entity.html).

2. The following table provides guidance on how to fill out OIDC provider registration form

   Field | Description | Recommended Value
   --- | --- | ---
   Name | A unique name that identifies the OAuth OIDC entity. | Azure AD
   Client ID | The client ID of the application registered in the third-party OAuth OIDC server. The instance uses the client ID when requesting an access token. | Application (Client) ID from step 3.a
   Client Secret | The client secret of the application registered in the third-party OAuth OIDC server. | Client Secret from step 3.b

   All other values can be default.

3. In the OIDC provider registration form, you need to add a new OIDC provider configuration. Select the search icon against *OAuth OIDC Provider Configuration* field to open the records of OIDC configurations. Select New.

4. The following table provides guidance on how to fill out OIDC provider configuration form

   Field | Recommended Value
   --- | ---
   OIDC Provider |  Azure AD
   OIDC Metadata URL | The URL must be in the form https\://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenandId">/.well-known/openid-configuration <br/>Replace "tenantID" with Directory (tenant) ID from step 3.a.
   OIDC Configuration Cache Life Span |  120
   Application | Global
   User Claim | sub
   User Field | User ID
   Enable JTI claim verification | Disabled

5. Select Submit and Update the OAuth OIDC Entity form.

### Step 3.3.5: Create a ServiceNow account

Refer the instructions to create a ServiceNow account, [create a user in ServiceNow](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/paris-platform-administration/page/administer/users-and-groups/task/t_CreateAUser.html).

The following table provides guidance on how to fill out the ServiceNow user account registration

Field | Recommended Value
--- | ---
User ID | Service Principal ID from step 3.c
Web service access only | Checked

All other values can be left to default.

### Step 3.3.6: Enable Knowledge role for the ServiceNow account

Access the ServiceNow account you created with ServiceNow Principal ID as User ID and assign the knowledge role. Instructions to assigning a role to a ServiceNow account can be found here, [assign a role to a user](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/paris-platform-administration/page/administer/users-and-groups/task/t_AssignARoleToAUser.html). Refer the table in the beginning of [step 3: connection settings](#step-3-connection-settings) for providing read access to more ServiceNow table records and index user criteria permissions.

Use Application ID as Client ID (from step 3.a), and Client secret (from step 3.b) in admin center configuration wizard to authenticate to your ServiceNow instance using Azure AD OpenID Connect.

## Step 4: Select properties and filter data

In this step, you can add or remove available properties from your ServiceNow data source. Microsoft 365 has already selected few properties by default.

With a ServiceNow query string, you can specify conditions for syncing articles. It's like a **Where** clause in a **SQL Select** statement. For example, you can choose to index only articles that are published and active. To learn about creating your own query string, see [Generate an encoded query string using a filter](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/paris-platform-user-interface/page/use/using-lists/task/t_GenEncodQueryStringFilter.html).

Use the preview results button to verify the sample values of the selected properties and query filter.

## Step 5: Manage search permissions

The ServiceNow connector supports search permissions visible to **Everyone** or **Only people with access to this data source**. Indexed data appears in the search results and is visible to all users in the organization or users who have access to them via user criteria permission respectively. If a knowledge article is not enabled with a user criteria, it will appear in search results of everyone in the organization.

ServiceNow Graph Connector supports default user criteria permissions without advanced scripts. When the connector encounters a user criteria with advanced script, all data using that user criteria will not appear in search results.

If you choose **Only people with access to this data source**, you need to further choose whether your ServiceNow instance has Azure Active Directory (AAD) provisioned users or Non-AAD users.

>[!NOTE]
>If you choose AAD as the type of identity source, make sure you are assigning UserPrincipalName (UPN) source property to email targeted property in ServiceNow. To verify or change your mappings, see [Customizing user provisioning attribute-mappings for SaaS applications in Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory/app-provisioning/customize-application-attributes).

If you have elected "non-AAD" for the identity type see [Map your non-Azure AD Identities](map-non-aad.md) for instructions on mapping the identities. 


## Step 6: Assign property labels

Follow the general setup instructions.

## Step 7: Manage schema

Follow the general setup instructions.

## Step 8: Choose refresh settings

Follow the general setup instructions.

>[!NOTE]
>For identities, only full crawl scheduled will be applied.

## Step 9: Review Connection

Follow the general [setup instructions](./configure-connector.md).

ServiceNow Knowledge Graph connector has the following limitations in its latest release:

After publishing the connection, you need to customize the search results page. To learn about customizing search results, see [Customize the search results page](/microsoftsearch/configure-connector#next-steps-customize-the-search-results-page).

## Limitations
ServiceNow Knowledge Graph connector has the following limitations in its latest release:
- Indexing knowledge articles available to everyone in an organization is a generally available feature.
- *Only people with access to this data source* feature under Manage Search permissions step is in targeted release channel and processes only [user criteria](https://hi.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0550924) permissions. Any other type of access permissions will not be applied in the search results.
- User criteria with advanced scripts are not supported in the current version. Any knowledge articles with such an access restriction will be indexed with deny everyone access i.e. they will not appear in search results to any user until we support them.

## Troubleshooting
After publishing your connection, customizing the results page, you can review the status under the **Data Sources** tab in the [admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com). To learn how to make updates and deletions, see [Manage your connector](manage-connector.md).
You can find troubleshooting steps for commonly seen issues below.
### 1. Unable to login due to Single Sign-On enabled ServiceNow instance

If your organization has enabled Single Sign-On (SSO) to ServiceNow, you may have trouble logging in with the service account. You can bring up username and password based login by adding <em> `login.do`</em> to the ServiceNow instance URL. Example. `https://<your-organization-domain>.service-now.com./login.do` 

### 2. Unauthorized or forbidden response to API request

#### 2.1. Check table access permissions
If you see forbidden or unauthorized response in connection status, check if the service account has required access to the tables mentioned in [step 3: connection settings](#step-3-connection-settings). Please check whether all the columns in the tables have read access.

#### 2.2. Check if ServiceNow instance behind firewall
Graph Connector may not be able to reach your ServiceNow instance if it is behind a network firewall. You will need explicitly allow access to Graph Connector service. You can find public IP address range of Graph Connector Service in the table below. Based on your tenant region, add it to your ServiceNow instance network whitelist.

**Environment** | **Region** | **Range**
--- | --- | ---
PROD | North America | 52.250.92.252/30, 52.224.250.216/30
PROD | Europe | 20.54.41.208/30, 51.105.159.88/30 
PROD | Asia Pacific | 52.139.188.212/30, 20.43.146.44/30 

#### 2.3. Access permissions not working as expected
If you observe discrepancies in access permissions applied to search results, verify access flow chart for user criteria in [managing access to knowledge bases and articles](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/rome-servicenow-platform/page/product/knowledge-management/concept/user-access-knowledge.html).
