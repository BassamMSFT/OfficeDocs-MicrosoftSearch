# Microsoft Graph out-of-the-box connectors Overview for Microsoft Search and Microsoft 365 Copilot

Microsoft Graph connectors provide a seamless way to integrate content from external services into Microsoft Graph, enhancing Microsoft 365 intelligent experiences such as Microsoft 365 Copilot and Microsoft Search. Microsoft Graph serves as the data fabric that underpins these intelligent experiences.
Microsoft offers a range of out-of-the-box (OOB) Graph connectors. These pre-built integrations facilitate connections between various third-party services and Microsoft products, enhancing data integration and functionality within the Microsoft ecosystem.

## Key points about Microsoft Graph out-of-the-box connectors
*Availability: Microsoft provides over 100 connectors, developed by Microsoft and its partners. These connectors support integration with popular services, including Azure, Box, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Google services, and MediaWiki.

*Functionality: These connectors enable the ingestion of external data into M365 Copilot, search experiences, and other Microsoft 365 applications. For instance, you can use Graph connectors to incorporate data from Salesforce and JIRA into M365 Copilot, create Declarative Copilots, and make data searchable within Microsoft Search.

*Configuration: Certain connectors, such as the enterprise site connector, can be configured to crawl dynamic content. Depending on the authentication requirements of the external service, you may need to add specific headers or user agents during the configuration process.
