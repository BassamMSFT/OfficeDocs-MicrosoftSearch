# General setup instructions for Graph connectors by Microsoft 

This article summarizes the basic process required to use the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com) to setup any of the Graph connectors by Microsoft. The basic process includes the following steps:  

1. Add a Graph connector in the Microsoft 365 admin center.
2. Name the connection.
3. Configure the connection settings.
4. Manage search persmissions.
5. Assign property labels.
6. Manage schema.
7. Choose refresh settings.
8. Review the connection.

It is important to note that the setup process is very similar for all the Graph connectors by Microsoft but is not exactly the same. **In addition to reading this article, be sure to read the connector-specific for your data source.**  

## Step 1: Add a Graph connector in the Microsoft 365 admin center

Complete the following steps to configure any of the Microsoft-built connectors.

1. Sign into your admin account in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com)
2. Go to the [Connectors tab](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/MicrosoftSearch/Connectors), which you can locate by selecting **Settings** in the navigation menu and then selecting **Microsoft Search**.
3. Select **+Add**.
4. Select the data source of your choice from the menu of available options.

>[!Note:] You can add a maximum of ten Graph connections to each tenant.

## Step 2: Name the connection
You will need to specify these attributes: 

* Name  
* Connection ID 
* Description (optional) 

The connection ID creates implicit properties for your connector. It must contain only alphanumeric characters and be a maximum of 32 characters. 

## Step 3: Configure the connection Settings

The process to configure the Connection settings varies based on the type of data source. See the Connector-specific information for the type of data source you want to add to your tenant to complete this step in the setup process.  

To learn more about connecting to an on-premises data source, see [Install an on-premises data gateway](https://aka.ms/configuregateway).

## Step 4: Manage search permissions
In this step you can choose whether to allow everyone in your organization to see search results from this data source. For some types of Graph connectors, you can also choose to allow only certain users to see search results from this data source. 

## Step 5: Assign property labels
You can assign a source property to each label by choosing from a menu of options. While this step is not mandatory, having some property labels will improve the search relevance and ensure more accurate search results for end users. By default, some of the Labels will already been assigned source properties.

## Step 6: Manage schema
You can manage the schema for the results that will be indexed. For a source property to be indexed, at least one of the following attributes must be selected: **Query, Search, Retrieve**.

### Content property
It is strongly recommended that you select a **Content Property" from the drop-down menu of options, or keep the default if one is present. This property is used for full-text indexing of content, search results page snippet generation, [result cluster](result-cluster.md) participation, language detection, HTML/text support, ranking and relevance, and query formulation. 

If you select a content property, you will have the option of using the system-generated property **ResultSnippet** when you [create your result type](customize-results-layout.md). This property serves as a placeholder for the dynamic snippets that are generated from the content property at query time. If you use this property in your result type, snippets will be generated in your search results.

### Search schema attributes

Your search schema determines what results display on the search results page and what information end users can view and access. The connection wizard automatically selects a search schema based on the set of source properties you chose. You can modify this schema by selecting the check boxes for each search schema attribute. The search schema attributes include **Query**, **Search**, and **Retrieve**. 

![Schema for a connector can be customized by adding or removing Query, Search, and Retrieve functions.](media/manageschema.png)

The following table explains the function of each of the search schema attributes attributes.

Search schema attribute | Function | Example
--- | --- | ---
QUERY | Searches by query for a match for a particular property. The property name can then be specified in the query either programmatically or verbatim. |  If the **Title** property is queryable, then the query **Title: Enterprise** is supported.
SEARCH | Makes the text content of a property searchable. Property contents are included in the full-text index. | If the **Title** property is searchable, then the query **Title: Enterprise** returns answers that contain the word "Enterprise" in any text or title.
RETRIEVE | Only retrievable properties can be used in the result type and displayed in the search result. | If the title property is retrievable, then

***What about the refine property?***

### Restrictions and recommendations for search schema settings

* The **content** property is searchable only. Once selected in the dropdown, this property cannot be marked **retrievable** or **queryable**. 

* Significant performance issues occur when search results render with the **content** property. An example is the **Text** content field for a [ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com) knowledge-base article.

* Only properties marked as retrievable render in the search results and can be used to create modern result types (MRTs).

* Only string properties can be marked searchable.


> [!Note]
> After you create a connection, you **can't** modify the schema. To do that, you need to delete your connection and create a new one.

## Step 7: Refresh settings

The refresh interval determines how often your data is synced with the index in Microsoft Graph and Microsoft Search. Each type of data source has a different set of optimal refresh schedules based on how often data is modified and the type of modifications.

There are two types of refresh intervals, which are **Full refresh** and **Incremental refresh**, but incremental refreshes are not available for some data sources.

With a **full refresh**, the search engine processes and indexes every item in the content source, regardless of previous crawls. Full refreshes works best for these situations:

* Detecting deletions of data.
* The incremental crawl failed to crawl content for errors.
* ACLs were modified.
* Crawl rules were modified.
* A software update for Microsoft Search is required. Updates modify the search schema.

***Should above be in parentheses?***

With an **incremental refersh**, the search engine can process and index only the items that were created or modified since the last successful crawl. Therefore, not all the data in the content source is re-indexed. Incremental refreshes work best to detect content, metadata, permission, and other updates.

Incremental refreshes are much faster than full refreshes because unchanged items arenâ€™t processed. However, if you choose to run incremental refreshes, you will still need to run full refreshes periodically to maintain an accurate data sync between the content source and the search index.

## Step 8: Review connection

You can review your entire configuration and edit settings as needed before completing the connection. **Be sure to read the connector-specific information for your data source if you have not already done so.** Select **Finish updating** when you are ready to complete the connection.

## How do I know the connection setup worked?

Go to the list of your published connections under the **Connectors** tab in the [admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com). To learn how to make updates and deletions, see [Manage your connector](manage-connector.md).
