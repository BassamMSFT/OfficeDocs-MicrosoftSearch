# Microsoft Graph connectors preview release and features

Microsoft Graph connectors and Microsoft Search APIs are now generally available. The initial rollout will be to customers configured for Targeted Release. This rollout will go on until the end of February 2021. Upon rollout completion to all tenants, index quota utilization from connectors content will become subject to billing. See [Licensing requirements and pricing](licensing.md) for more information.

## Set up Targeted release

If you want to use Graph connectors in your tenant during rollout, you **must** opt into Targeted release. To learn more about the Targeted release option and how to set it, see [Set up the Standard or Targeted release options in Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/manage/release-options-in-office-365?view=o365-worldwide).

* [Salesforce connector](salesforce-connector.md)
